These files are needed for an example of AJAX on a website.

The script in ajax.html can be edited at the indicated areas to pull different files from the server.  Simply copy the files over to your server in order to see them in action.

Note: The w3schoolsajax.html code is the code I found from the Internet to base my sandbox code from; it is not needed to test my sandbox code.
